        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            CryoPCM-Lab is an open scientific repository dedicated to collecting,
            curating, and visualizing thermophysical properties of phase-change
            materials suitable for cryogenic energy recovery applications. This project is solely for educational purposes and is not intended for commercial use.

        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>Cryogenic energy recovery is one of the important aspects of energy sustainability. Recovery of cold released from regasification of industrially liquefied gases 
            such as air, hydrogen and natural gas can serve the refrigeration and air conditioning needs of the industries. Cryogenic phase-change materials (PCMs) serve as energy storage medium
            which can be used to store and release this cold energy as and when required.  Currently PCMs based energy recovery systems are currently under lab scale investigations and researchers are actively in sought of new material and system Designing the recovery system requires the knowledge of the thermophysical properties of the PCMs.
            and thier varitaion with temerature.
            </p> 
            <p>Exising  thermophysical property data of various compounds that act as PCMs are scattered among the open literature and are often in tabular format or grpahical format 
            and are less legible. Hence, users may have to go through numerous papers and manually extract the data - a task which is both time taking and laborious.
            This tool adrreses these challenge- cryoPCM--lab is a one stop solution providing a user friendly interface to explore the property data all one at place.  What would take months altogether can now be done within a single click of a button.         </p>
